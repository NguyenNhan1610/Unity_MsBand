Unity3D Microsoft Band Plugin For Android

Over the last year or so I have developed several plugins that allow use of the Microsoft Band, within Android based Unity3D applications. Finally, the time has come to release at least one of them (the most functional if not simple) to the masses.

For more information please see: http://www.dyadica.co.uk/controlling-virtual-experiences-using-biometrics/

There may be a few glitches initialy as I sort out the example files but its all functional :)

In reality all this plugin is; is a wrapper for the official and excellent Microsoft SDK (microsoft-band-1.3.20217.2.jar) which uses the Unityplayer.UnitySendMessage method to relay data to the unity application. So thanks and kudos must really go to Microsoft not only for producing a great product, but also for providing great developer support.
